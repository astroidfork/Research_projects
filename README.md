# Research_projects
This is for putting all of my research based projects on here. My research projects will be based based on ML, and optimization with a focus on chemical engineering papers that I find. I will basically be replicating the results to see if I get the same results. After I feel that I can just approach just about any paper in optimization or one based on machine learning. I will create my own project and write a small bit on what I find. I might go with other. This is the first repository that I am going to upload. As I become more confident. I am going to expand myself towards more design based projects and try exploring differnt research ideas.
