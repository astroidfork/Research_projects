#ReadMe
# This is my first fake readme file. I am at one of the worst points in my life, and I have decided that I am going to push myself to suceed at challenging things, 
# and get a good amount of satisfaction. Anyway, this project was from december 2022. I was unfinished because of my shit unit ops teammates. If I had more time, 
# I would have finished the project. Now I am going to prove that. I am going to start 3/30. I am going to finish 4/12. THis is subsequently the same day as my 
# design class exam 2. I am going to write out daily progess reports

#COde
#BD - Beginning of the day plan
#ED - End of the day(what happend)

#BDP (6/14)
# 1. Make sure to find where you left off for the project

#BDP (6/14,15,16)
# 1.  Make sure you impliment eqiuations correctly, and can obtain results for 1 time period
# 2. Make sure you can obtain all the needed values for the optimization

#BDP(6/17,18)
# 1. Impliment the epsilon constraint method properly

#BDP 6/19,6/20)
# 1.  Make sure you impliment eqiuations correctly, for multiple time periods and results

#BDP (6/21)
# 1. If you find a mistake or checking the work, and that you have the minimum number of equations that you can impliment
# 2. Reflection- 1 Page on what you did correclty and what I could have done better
