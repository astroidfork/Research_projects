#ReadMe
# This is my first fake readme file. I am at one of the worst points in my life, and I have decided that I am going to push myself to suceed at challenging things, 
# and get a good amount of satisfaction. Anyway, this project was from december 2022. I was unfinished because of my shit unit ops teammates. If I had more time, 
# I would have finished the project. Now I am going to prove that. I am going to start 3/30. I am going to finish 4/12. THis is subsequently the same day as my 
# design class exam 2. I am going to write out daily progess reports
